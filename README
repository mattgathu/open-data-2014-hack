            OPEN DATA DAY 2014 HACK
====================================================================================

This is a simple hack I need for the Open Data Kenya 2014 Open Data Day, with the help
of: >>>
    >>>


The application visualizes some scraped data that's in the csv file.

The data is on form one students admissions to National Schools in 2014.
The visualization simply shows a ratio of the students from public primary
schools versus those from private schools.

The is a lot of the other great analysis that can be done on the data,
and the dataset is to be cleaned and be publicly shared.


There were about 16000 records, so you can get some more interesting trends from 
it. 

My project/hack was time constrained hence the simplicity but I might improve and 
do a more intensive and interesting analysis.


The analysis is in pure python; it wasn't big enough to demand robust libraries such
as pandas and scipy. Simple sorting greatly reduces the computational quotient.
However you can always use other tools for analysis :-)
